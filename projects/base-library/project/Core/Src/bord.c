 * Description: In bord.c you can find the functions for things that are directly related to the pins on the board
 * such as I2C, USART, ADC, PWN and GPIO. The peripheral configuration is done on Cube MX.

 * Author: Jordan, Matthew, Peter (Contact these team members if you have any questions)
 *
 * Notes: The peripherals are configured such that it fullfills the general need of the boat's sub-electrical system.
